# 📊 Google Trends Meets Reality: A Time Series Data Analysis Project

In this project, I explore whether the popularity of Google search terms reveals anything meaningful about the **real-world data** like stock prices and economic indicators.

## 🔍 What I Investigated
- 📈 Is there a relationship between **Tesla's stock price** and how much it's searched on Google?
- ₿ Does **Bitcoin's price** follow spikes in "Bitcoin" search interest?
- 🧑‍💼 Can we anticipate changes in **unemployment** based on search volume for "Unemployment Benefits"?

## 📁 Datasets Used
- [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore)
- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- [US Unemployment Rate - FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- 🐼 Pandas for data manipulation and resampling
- 📉 Time series alignment and cleaning
- 📅 Customizing time axis with Locators and Formatters
- 🎨 Beautiful, publication-ready visualizations with Matplotlib
- 🧠 Extracting insight from rolling averages and seasonality

## 📸 Sample Visualizations
- Dual-axis comparison of Tesla stock price vs. web search interest
- Quarterly Bitcoin price vs. search trend
- Unemployment rate vs. benefits search volume — revealing potential leading indicators
